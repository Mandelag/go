# Utility Scripts
To make software engineer life easier

## Preface

There is a saying in Indonesia that says "bisa karena biasa." It means (you're) able because (you're) used to it.

I want to be an able software engineer that can write clean code with proper documentation, usage examples, test cases, etc.
I want to get used to proper software engineering practices.
I created this repo to practice this.
